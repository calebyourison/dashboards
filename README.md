# Dashboards
---
This repository serves as a central location to host various dashboards that one can either copy and use,
or perhaps gain inspiration to build something else that better fits their needs.

## online_hosts
---
Just a basic visual representation of hosts that respond to a ping, and hosts that respond to specific ports. 
This can be useful when observing the behavior of IP cameras.
As currently written, one must designate exactly which hosts to observe.
It could be re-written to observe an entire subnet if desired.

In order to use it, install the `tech-tools` and `dash` packages, and then copy the file to your directory.

Update the various configurations: update frequency, hosts of interest, ports of interest, and various color customizations if desired.

## DISCLAIMER

**As with any networking tools, 
ensure that you only use them in environments for which you have been given explicit permission to operate.
